# Guiding Principles of PSA training

## Who provide training?

- Any PSA member will share the approved training materials. 
    - To submit your materials, just fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zkzqmedS_MWvGufwdoIUoOKvGRxf4-psCPJVFA35TH4/viewform?edit_requested=true).
- Training materials would be text or multimedia.

## Training modules

- **PSA sepcific**: Overview of PSA network and projects. how to propose a PSA project; how to manage multi-lab data collection; how to organize PSA relative activities.

- **Methodological**: Research method/toolkits. how to use survey software; how to use research software.

- **Statistical**: Guides to conduct a specific analysis, statistical software, and a comprehensible report.

- **Open-Science**: Recommended practices for transparency, methodology, and general skills for open science. how to use GitHub, OSF; how to write reproducible document. 

## Distribution of approved training materials

- Three approvement types: (1) for general purpose; (2) for PSA-specific; (3) for PSA-requested.
- **We are going to assign four managers to each module.**
- **Translation issue**: Provided materials are not in (1) the committee's spoken languages and (2) committee's living area.
- **Distribution issue**: How to motivate the scientists in non-English area recognize/realize/appreciate the Open Science practices?

>- provide small grants to research teams as needed (Community committee)
>- engage additional disciplines

# Works to be initialized

## Missions

How to manage the systematic translations of training modules across languages/countries?<br>
<br>
How to forster the Open Science Communities out of non-English world?

## Team members

**Ancher members**: Stay in one mission till the end. Keep the note of any suggestion. Give the hints for the swap members. One mission has 1 ~ 2 ancher member(s).

**Swap members**: Provide individual suggestions to the present mission. Switch to the other mission between Hacks. Rest of us are swap members.
